# Equity

In accounting, **equity** refers to the ownership interest in a company, representing the residual value of the company's assets after deducting its liabilities. It essentially reflects the net worth of the company and belongs to the owners or shareholders.



`Equity = Assets âˆ’ Liabilities`



Equity represents the value that would be returned to the shareholders if all assets were liquidated and all liabilities were settled.
