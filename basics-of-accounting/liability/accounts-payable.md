# Accounts Payable

Accounts payable (AP) refers to the money a business owes to its suppliers or vendors for goods or services received but not yet paid for. It represents a liability on the company's balance sheet, indicating the company's obligation to make payments in the future.

Accounts payable are typically created when a business purchases goods or services on credit.

Since it's a liability account, it has a credit balance, meaning it increases with credits and decreases with debits.
