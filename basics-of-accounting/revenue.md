# Revenue

**Revenue** refers to the income generated by a business from its normal operating activities, such as selling goods, providing services, or earning interest. Revenue is a key indicator of a company’s financial performance and is crucial for assessing its ability to generate profit.

### Key Aspects

1. **Definition**
   * **Revenue** is the total amount of money received or receivable by a business before any expenses or costs are deducted. It represents the inflow of economic resources resulting from the primary activities of the business.
2. **Recognition**
   * Revenue is recognized in accordance with the **accrual basis** of accounting. This means revenue is recorded when it is earned, not necessarily when cash is received. The timing of revenue recognition can vary based on the nature of the transaction, such as upon delivery of goods, completion of services, or at the point of sale.
3. **Types of Revenue**
   * **Sales Revenue:** Income from selling goods or products.
   * **Service Revenue:** Income from providing services to customers.
   * **Interest Revenue:** Income earned from investments or deposits.
   * **Rental Revenue:** Income from leasing out property or equipment.
   * **Other Revenue:** Income from non-operating activities, such as gains from asset sales or one-time transactions.
4. **Revenue Accounts**
   * A **revenue account** is a type of account in the general ledger used to record and track all revenue transactions. Revenue accounts are classified as part of the income statement, which reflects the business’s performance over a specific period.
