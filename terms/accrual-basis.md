# Accrual Basis

The accrual basis of accounting is a method of recording financial transactions where revenues and expenses are recognized when they are earned or incurred, regardless of when cash transactions occur.&#x20;



#### Revenue

Revenue is recognized when it is earned, which is typically when goods are delivered or services are provided, not necessarily when cash is received. This approach reflects the income earned by the business regardless of the timing of cash receipts.

#### Expenses

Expenses are recognized when they are incurred, meaning when they are used to generate revenue, not necessarily when they are paid. This ensures that expenses are matched with the revenues they help to generate, providing a clearer picture of profitability.
