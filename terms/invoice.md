# Invoice

An invoice is a payment demand issued by a seller to the buyer of goods or services after the sale, detailing what goods have been provided or work completed and how much must be paid in return.



### Bill vs Invoice

In the context of Indian businesses, an invoice is a document issued by a seller to a buyer, detailing the goods or services provided, the quantity, price, and payment terms. It serves as a formal request for payment and is used to record sales transactions. A bill, on the other hand, is a document received by a buyer from a seller or service provider, indicating the amount owed for goods or services purchased. While the terms are often used interchangeably, in accounting, the **invoice is from the perspective of the seller**, and the **bill is from the perspective of the buyer**. Both are essential for tracking transactions and ensuring proper financial documentation.



### Types of Invoice

#### **Pro forma Invoices**

A pro forma invoice is an invoice sent in advance of a shipment of goods where payment, or at least part payment, is required before the delivery of the goods.

Pro forma invoices are often estimated and are typically used in international transactions to satisfy customs regulations as they contain critical information on the weight and transportation charges of goods.

#### **Credit notes**

A credit note is issued when an invoice has been raised for ordered goods but there is a discrepancy between the order and what was delivered. This discrepancy could be down to an error when raising the invoice originally, loss of goods in transit, damaged goods, cancellation of purchase or other reasons.

A credit note covering the cost of the lost/damaged/cancelled goods is issued to balance the accounts of both parties involved.

Credit notes can be issued for both incoming and outgoing payments and can be used to show that an amount that was paid by a customer has been returned or that a customer's due payment on an invoice was cancelled.
