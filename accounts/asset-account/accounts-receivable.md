# Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable (AR) refers to the money that a business is owed by its customers for goods or services that have been delivered or used but not yet paid for. It **represents an asset on** the company's balance sheet, as it indicates the company's right to receive cash in the future.

Overall accounts receivable refers to the businessâ€™s outstanding invoices, or in other words, the money that your company is owed by clients.

Since it's an asset account, it has a debit balance, meaning it increases with debits and decreases with credits.
