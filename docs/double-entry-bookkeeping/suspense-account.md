# Suspense Account

As the name suggests, a suspense account is an account that temporarily records amounts that are yet to have their proper accounts determined.&#x20;

A typical suspense account example is running a trial balance to check a double-entry balance sheet. If there is an anomaly, this amount is placed in a suspense account until the balance is corrected, and the amount is accurately placed in the right account. Just like any to-do pile, the suspense account cannot hold your mystery amounts forever, and its proper place will need to be determined. Businesses may decide to clear their suspense accounts quarterly or monthly.
