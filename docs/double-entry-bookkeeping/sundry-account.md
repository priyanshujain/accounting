# Sundry Account

A sundry account refers to a category of accounts used to group together small or miscellaneous items that do not fit into any specific category. The term "sundry" means "various" or "miscellaneous," so sundry accounts are typically used for minor or infrequent transactions that are not significant enough to have their own individual accounts.

### Common Types of Sundry Accounts

1. **Sundry Debtors:**
   * This account is used to record amounts owed to the business by various customers who have purchased goods or services on credit. Sundry Debtors represent the total receivables from these customers.
   * In cases where there are many small debtors, or the amounts are not significant enough to be tracked individually, they might be grouped under the Sundry Debtors account.
2. **Sundry Creditors:**
   * This account is used to record amounts that the business owes to various suppliers or vendors from whom goods or services have been purchased on credit. Sundry Creditors represent the total payables to these suppliers.
   * Similar to Sundry Debtors, if there are many small creditors or insignificant amounts, they are grouped under Sundry Creditors.
3. **Sundry Expenses:**
