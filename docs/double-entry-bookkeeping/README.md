# Double Entry Bookkeeping

Double-entry bookkeeping is an accounting system that rules that for every entry into one account, an equal entry must be made in another account.

Double-entry bookkeeping maintains that there must be an equal debit for every credit a company records in its accounting system.

### Features

* Debits are always on the left-hand side. Debits will increase an asset account or decrease a liability account. **Debits decrease revenue**.
* Credits are always on the right-hand side. Credits will increase a liability account but decrease an asset account. **Credits increase revenue**.\


The double-entry bookkeeping system is based on the following formula:

> Assets = Liabilities + Equity

This is known as the accounting equation. The equity portion of a balance sheet includes the profit or loss made for all time, including the current period.



### Example

To understand how double-entry bookkeeping works, look at the example below. In this case, we'll focus on a company that sells apples.

First, we need to invest in the business. We invest 100,000 – the double-entry bookkeeping example for this is below

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="249"></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Account</strong></td><td><strong>Debit</strong></td><td><strong>Credit</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Cash</td><td>100,000</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Equity</td><td> </td><td>100,000</td></tr></tbody></table>

Now, we need to buy a shop front to sell the apples from. The shop's value is 500,000, so let's assume we take out a loan for the full amount.

| **Account**          | **Debit** | **Credit** |
| -------------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Property             | 500,000   | -          |
| Liability (Mortgage) |           | 500,000    |

We need to buy some actual apples to sell. Let's buy 10,000 worth of inventory – this is a cost.

| **Account** | **Debit** | **Credit** |
| ----------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Inventory   | 10,000    | -          |
| Cash        |           | 10,000     |

Time to sell. We sold all the apples for 12,000.

| **Account** | **Debit** | **Credit** |
| ----------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Cash        | 12,000    | -          |
| Revenue     |           | 12,000     |

Putting all this double-entry bookkeeping data together will form a trial balance and the financial statements.

| **Account** | **Debit**   | **Credit**  |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Property    | 500,000     | -           |
| Inventory   | -           |             |
| Cash        | 102,000     |             |
| Liabilities |             | 500,000     |
| Equity      |             | 100,000     |
| Revenue     |             | 12,000      |
| Costs       | 10,000      |             |
|             |             |             |
| **Total**   | **612,000** | **612,000** |

Notice how there is no inventory left, as everything bought was sold. Also, notice how cash has changed. We initially started with 100,000, spent 10,000 to buy apples (90,000 remaining). However, we made 12,000 by selling those same apples. So, 100 – 10 + 12 = 102.

Because of the accuracy of double-entry bookkeeping, we can now form other financial statements with correctly balanced data.
