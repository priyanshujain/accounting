# Transaction

Transactions are any record of money movement that directly affect the financial status or statements of a business.&#x20;

**Transactions** fall into one of two categories: **Accounts Receivable** and **Accounts Payable**.&#x20;

* Accounts receivable indicate that the holder (to whom the account belongs) is **owed** something.
* Accounts payable indicate that the holder (to whom the account belongs) **owes** something.

Account receivables and account payables are accounts on a company’s general ledger. A general ledger is a set of numbered accounts used to keep track of transactions.&#x20;

The following are common fields used in several of the transactions objects:

* contact: the contact to whom the transaction belongs to.
* total\_amount: the total amount being paid after taxes.
* memo: an internal note used by the business to clarify the purpose of the transaction.
* transaction\_date: the date the transaction was made.
* number: the transaction’s number used for identifying purposes.
