# Introduction

If you are learning about accounting as developer you may feel – as I did – that most of the material available doesn’t quite relate to the developer mindset. I made an attempt to distill the core explanation of double entry accounting.

> 1. Each account has a ‘type’ (asset, liability, revenue, expense, equity).
> 2. **Debits decrease** the value of an account. Always.&#x20;
> 3. **Credits increase** the value of an account. Always.&#x20;
> 4. The sign of any **asset** or **expense** account balance is **always flipped** upon display (i.e. multiply by -1). A simple explanation for this is, _‘accountants don’t like negative numbers.’_
> 5. A transaction is comprised of 1 or more credits **and** 1 or more debits (i.e. money must come from somewhere and then go somewhere).
> 6. The value of a transaction’s debits and credits must be equal (money into transaction = money out of transaction).
