# Introduction

If you're a developer transitioning into accounting, you might find traditional explanations a bit abstract. This guide break down the core concepts of double-entry accounting in a way that resonates with your technical mindset.

**Key Principles**

1. **Account Types:** Each account falls into one of five categories: assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, or equity.
2. **Debits and Credits:**
   * **Debits:** Decrease asset and expense accounts while increasing liability, revenue, and equity accounts.
   * **Credits:** Increase asset and expense accounts while decreasing liability, revenue, and equity accounts.
3. **Account Balance Convention:**
   * **Assets and Expenses:** Typically displayed as negative values. This is a convention, not a mathematical necessity.
   * **Liabilities, Revenues, and Equity:** Typically displayed as positive values.
4. **Transactions:**
   * **Dual Effect:** Every transaction involves at least one debit and at least one credit.
   * **Balance:** The total value of debits must equal the total value of credits in a transaction.

**Visualizing Double-Entry**

Imagine a seesaw. One side represents debits, and the other represents credits. To keep the seesaw balanced, any increase on one side must be offset by an equal increase or decrease on the other.

**Example: Purchasing Inventory**

* **Debit:** Inventory (asset) increases (debit).
* **Credit:** Cash (asset) decreases (credit).

Since the total increase in inventory is equal to the total decrease in cash, the seesaw remains balanced.

### Summary

> 1. Each account has a ‘type’ (asset, liability, revenue, expense, equity).
> 2. **Debits decrease** the value of an account. Always.&#x20;
> 3. **Credits increase** the value of an account. Always.&#x20;
> 4. The sign of any **asset** or **expense** account balance is **always flipped** upon display (i.e. multiply by -1). A simple explanation for this is, _‘accountants don’t like negative numbers.’_
> 5. A transaction is comprised of 1 or more credits **and** 1 or more debits (i.e. money must come from somewhere and then go somewhere).
> 6. The value of a transaction’s debits and credits must be equal (money into transaction = money out of transaction)
