# Balance Sheet

A balance sheet is a financial statement within a business that shows a static snapshot of the company's financial position - what it owns, what it owes and how much is invested in the business.

Also known as a 'statement of financial position', a balance sheet is one of the core financial statements within a business, alongside the profit and loss (P\&L) statement, cash flow statement and aged debtor reports.
