# Debt

In accounting, debt refers to the amount of money that a business or individual owes to external parties, such as banks, financial institutions, or other creditors. Debt arises when a business borrows funds, typically in the form of loans, bonds, or other financial instruments, with the obligation to repay the borrowed amount (principal) along with any agreed-upon interest over time.

Debt is considered a liability on the balance sheet, as it represents an obligation to pay back borrowed funds in the future.

The cost of borrowing is recorded as interest expense in the income statement.
