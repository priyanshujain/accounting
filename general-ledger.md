# General Ledger

The general ledger is a central repository that records all of a company's financial transactions across different accounts.

### Basics

General ledger basics boil down to record keeping. The term simply refers to the financial record-keeping system that a company uses to keep track of its data. This includes both debit and credit accounts, allowing businesses to balance transactions. Financial data is separated into separate accounts for expenses, revenues, equity, liabilities, and assets; all of which make up the entirety of the general ledger.

By holding all this information in one place, the general ledger forms the basis of a double-entry accounting system.&#x20;

### How does it work?

Transactions are recorded in the general ledger as separate entries to each sub-ledger account.&#x20;

Finally, after inputting your entries into the general ledger, you need to balance the books using the accounting equation as If the sum of debits doesn’t equal the sum of credits, this means there’s an error somewhere in your accounts which should be investigated.\
